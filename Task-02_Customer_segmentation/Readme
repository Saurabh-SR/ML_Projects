K-Means Clustering for Retail Store Customer Segmentation
Project Overview
This project aims to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history using the K-Means clustering algorithm. 
The goal is to identify distinct customer segments that can be targeted with tailored marketing strategies and promotions.

Project Steps:-

Data Preparation:
 Data Collection: Collected customer purchase history data, including features such as annual income, spending score, and demographics.
 Preprocessing: Scaled the data to ensure all features have equal influence on the clustering process.

Determining Optimal Clusters:
 Elbow Method: Used to determine the optimal number of clusters by plotting the Sum of Squared Distances (SSD) for different values of K.
 Silhouette Score: Assessed clustering quality for different numbers of clusters to find the best K that maximizes the silhouette score.

Clustering:
 Applied the K-Means algorithm with the identified optimal number of clusters.
 Analyzed cluster centers to understand the typical profile of each customer segment.

Results Analysis:
 Cluster Characteristics: Summarized average features (e.g., age, income, spending score) of each cluster to gain insights into different customer groups.
 Visualization: Created 3D scatter plots to visually represent customer segments based on key features like annual income, gender, and spending score.

Insights and applications:
 Provided actionable insights based on customer segmentation.
 Suggested targeted marketing strategies and personalized offers for each identified customer segment.

Results
 Optimal Number of Clusters: Determined based on SSD and silhouette score analysis.
 Customer Segments: Defined distinct segments with unique purchasing behaviors and characteristics.
 Visualizations: Enabled better understanding of customer distribution and segment differentiation through 3D plots.
  Usage
The segmentation results can be used for targeted marketing personalized customer engagement 
and strategic decision-making to enhance customer satisfaction and increase sales.

Dependencies
Python libraries: Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Pandas
