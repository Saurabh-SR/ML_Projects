# Image Classification with Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Image classification is a core task in computer vision, involving the assignment of predefined labels to images based on their visual content. 
This task has applications in object recognition, facial recognition, autonomous vehicles, and medical imaging.

Techniques for Image Classification
Several techniques can be used for image classification. 
In this project, we focus on Support Vector Machines (SVM) a traditional machine learning method known for its robustness and effectiveness in classification tasks.

# Support Vector Machines (SVMs):
SVMs are a type of supervised machine learning algorithm that are often used for classification tasks. 
They work by finding the optimal hyperplane that maximally separates different classes in the feature space. 
In the context of image classification, SVMs are applied to extracted image features rather than raw pixel values. 
This makes them effective when combined with techniques like feature extraction from deep learning models such as VGG16.

# Other Popular Techniques for Image Classification:
**Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Deep learning models that are highly effective at learning spatial hierarchies and patterns in images.
Transfer Learning: Using pre-trained deep learning models (e.g., VGG16) to extract features from images, followed by fine-tuning on a target dataset.

**Random Forests and Decision Trees:** Machine learning techniques that can be used after extracting features from images.

**Why Use SVMs for Image Classification?**

High Performance: SVMs perform well on small to medium-sized datasets, particularly when the data is high-dimensional.
Feature-Based Classification: SVMs are suitable for classification tasks where deep features are extracted from images using models like VGG16.
Kernel Trick: The use of non-linear kernels, such as the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel, allows SVMs to classify complex, non-linear data.

# Dataset
For this project, we used the Dogs vs Cats dataset. The dataset consists of images of cats and dogs, labeled accordingly. After extracting features from these images using the VGG16 model, we used an SVM classifier to classify each image.

Dataset: The dataset contains images of dogs and cats.
Labels: Each image is labeled as either Dog or Cat.
