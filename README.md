# Prodigy Internship - Machine Learning Projects
I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to Prodigy Infotech for the invaluable opportunity to work on these projects and for the exceptional support and guidance provided throughout my internship. Below is a summary of the tasks I worked on during my time at Prodigy Infotech:

# Task 1: House Price Prediction
This project involves constructing a simple linear regression model aimed at predicting house prices based on features such as square footage number of bedrooms and number of bathrooms. The model was inspired by previous work in the field to develop a predictive tool that estimates house prices with accuracy using historical data.

# Task 2: Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering 
In this project, I applied the K-Means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history. The objective was to identify distinct customer segments that can be targeted with tailored marketing strategies. Key steps included data scaling, determining the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method and silhouette score, and analyzing the characteristics of each cluster. The final results were visualized using 3D scatter plots to better understand customer distribution and segment differentiation.
