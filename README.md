# Prodigy Internship - Machine Learning Projects
I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to Prodigy Infotech for the invaluable opportunity to work on these projects and for the exceptional support and guidance provided throughout my internship. Below is a summary of the tasks I worked on during my time at Prodigy Infotech:

# Task 1: House Price Prediction
This project involves constructing a simple linear regression model aimed at predicting house prices based on features such as square footage number of bedrooms and number of bathrooms. The model was inspired by previous work in the field to develop a predictive tool that estimates house prices with accuracy using historical data.
