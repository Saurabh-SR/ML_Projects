# House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques
Problem Statement
Accurate prediction of house prices is crucial for the real estate industry. This project aims to forecast house prices based on various features, using the Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) metric to evaluate model performance. The RMSE is calculated using the logarithms of predicted and actual sales prices, ensuring balanced error evaluation across different price ranges.

Objective
The main goals of this project are:

Prediction Accuracy: Develop a model that predicts house prices with high accuracy across various price ranges.
Logarithmic Transformation: Apply a logarithmic transformation to prices to equalize error impact.
Generalization: Train and validate the model to ensure it performs well on new, unseen data.
Model Robustness: Build a model that maintains reliability despite market fluctuations.
Interpretability: Provide clear insights into the factors influencing predictions.
Target Data
The target variable for this project is:

SalePrice: The price of the house, which we aim to predict.
Project Functioning
The project involves the following steps:

Data Preparation: Load and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
Feature Selection: Identify relevant features that influence house prices.
Model Building: Implement and train a regression model to predict house prices.
Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using RMSE to ensure accurate predictions.
Submission: Generate predictions for the test set and format them as required for submission.
Results
At the end of the project, a graph of regression results is displayed to visualize the model's performance and predictions.
